# Leger-UI frontend compiler

> Don't use Leger-UI in production.

While *actually* working with Leger-UI V2, I realized, it kinda sucks to make dynamic elements with it.
But while making a library to compensate for that, I had the **brilliant** idea to build it into Leger-UI.
Hopefully this version will be good !
